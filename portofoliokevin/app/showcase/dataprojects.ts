During my internship, I realized that I sometimes lacked technical confidence when discussing frontend implementation with developers. Therefore, I decided to practice directly by building my own website interface.",

Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of frontend development, including rendering concepts, JavaScript basics, UI styling(especially use tailwindcss), React Hooks, API concepts, navigation, component grouping, and the use of various reusable components specifically within the React ecosystem.",
